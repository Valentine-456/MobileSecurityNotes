# Mobile Security Notes

**This project is one of the Mobile Systems Security's course home assignments:**

> **Exercise 1:** *Write a program - secure notepad - the access to which will be secured by a password. After providing the password, the user should be able to display the stored note, change it, change the password. Providing an incorrect password should of course result in lack of access to the note and any possibility of changing the password.*


> **Exercise 3:** *Implement exercise 1 from lab 1 again. This time, however, do it properly - in such a way that accessing the hidden message without the password is difficult. Perhaps you will find the vulnerabilities discovered by your classmates (they will appear after task deadline has passed) to be illuminating. You can use libraries available for your chosen programming environment.*

> **Exercise 4:** *Change exercise 1 from lab 1, so that the program, instead of asking for a password, allows the user to log in using their fingerprint. You can use libraries available for your chosen programming environment. You have to defend your source code and demonstrate how it works - ideally during labs.*

> **Exercise 5:** *Modify your program from previous exercises so that it offers two authentication methods - password and fingerprint (or other biometric method) and lets the user authenticate using either one - both should be available, i.e. the user should have freedom of choice every time they try to gain access - it is not allowed to ever force the user to use both methods. Remember to secure the note properly, nevertheless.*
